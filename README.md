# Database-Project
The introduction to database course project. Made with Yu Zhang and Sofiia Barysheva. 


CURRENT PROBLEMS:

unable to view private items. Look at the query used at /home and you can see that we show
only if the contentitem is public or if the person belongs to a group that it is shared to. 
But no firendgroups are supported right now, so private items are current broken
